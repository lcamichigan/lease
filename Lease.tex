\section*{Sigma Alumni Association \leaseDescription\ Lease}

This lease (the \definedTermDeclaration{Lease}) is made between
\emph{Sigma Alumni Association of Lambda Chi Alpha,~Inc.}, a Michigan nonprofit
corporation (the \definedTermDeclaration{Landlord}), and
\emph{\tenantName} (the \definedTermDeclaration{Tenant}). Tenant, whose address
is \emph{\tenantAddress}, is a member of \emph{Sigma Zeta} (the
\definedTermDeclaration{Chapter}) of \emph{Lambda Chi Alpha} (the
\definedTermDeclaration{Fraternity}). Landlord’s billing service (the
\definedTermDeclaration{Billing Service}) is \emph{GreekBill,~Inc.}, whose
address is \emph{23224 Crenshaw Blvd, Torrance CA 90505-3171}.

\subsection{Premises}
\emph{1601 Washtenaw Ave, Ann Arbor MI 48104-3586} is the
\definedTermDeclaration{Premises}. Landlord agrees to lease to Tenant a room in
the Premises. Tenant shall select this room according to the policies of the
Chapter, and Tenant shall have full, non-exclusive access to and use of this
room.

\subsection{Tenants and Common Areas}
Tenant together with other lessees of the Premises are the
\definedTermDeclaration{Tenants}. Tenant shall share non-exclusive use of common
areas of the Premises with other lessees of the Premises.

\subsection{Term}
The term of this Lease (the \definedTermDeclaration{Term}) is
\emph{\the\termDuration\ 24-hour periods} starting on
\emph{\DTMusedate{lease start date}} and ending on
\emph{\DTMusedate{lease end date}}.

\subsection{Rent}
All rent herein is reserved. Tenant shall pay to Landlord rent for the Term of
\emph{\rentTotal}, plus all other rent that becomes due under this Lease. Rent
shall be paid in monthly installments by the due dates in the first column of
the table below and in the amounts to the right of such dates:

{
  \addfontfeatures{Numbers=Monospaced}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}rl}
    \textbf{Rent Due Date} & \textbf{Rent}\\
    \rentTable
  \end{tabular}
}

Rent is paid only when received by Landlord. If Tenant’s rent check is returned
unpaid, Tenant shall pay as additional rent any returned check fees. The
foregoing fees shall be paid by the 15th~day of the calendar month following the
month in which they accrue. Landlord, in its sole discretion, may require
monthly installments to be paid with certified funds or money orders and in a
single payment.

Tenant shall not pay rent in cash to any person, including representatives of
Landlord or Billing Service.

\subsection{Late Lease Fee}
If Tenant delivers this signed Lease to Landlord after
\emph{\DTMusedate{lease due date}} (the
\definedTermDeclaration{Lease Due Date}), Tenant shall pay to Landlord as
additional rent a late lease fee of \emph{\$20.00} per month after the Lease Due
Date by the start of the Term of this Lease. For avoidance of doubt, if this
Lease is delivered from \DTMmonthname{\themonth}
\DTMsavedate{lease due date month end}{%
  \DTMfetchmonth{lease due date}-\DTMfetchmonth{lease due date}-last%
}%
2–\DTMfetchday{lease due date month end}, \DTMfetchyear{lease due date}, then
Tenant shall pay a late lease fee of \$20.00; if this Lease is delivered in
{%
  \DTMsetdatestyle{month year}%
  \stepcounter{month}%
  \DTMdate{\DTMfetchyear{lease due date}-\themonth-01}, then Tenant shall pay a
  late lease fee of \$40.00; if this Lease is delivered in
  \stepcounter{month}%
  \DTMdate{\DTMfetchyear{lease due date}-\themonth-01}, then Tenant shall pay a
  late lease fee of \$60.00; and so on.
}

\subsection{Security Deposit}
Tenant shall pay to Landlord a security deposit of \emph{\securityDeposit} by
\emph{\DTMusedate{security deposit due date}}. Landlord shall deposit Tenant’s
security deposit in \emph{\securityDepositLocation}.

If Tenant adheres to the provisions in this Lease, moves out of the Premises by
the end of the Term, and returns the Premises to Landlord in the same condition
it was in upon taking possession (other than normal wear and tear), Landlord
will return to Tenant the full amount of the security deposit within 30~days
after the end of the Term. If Tenant does not adhere to the provisions in this
Lease, Landlord may keep all or part of Tenant’s security deposit to pay
Landlord for any damages or losses incurred, including missed payments.

Landlord is not responsible for allocating shares of the security deposit or for
attributing individual liability for charges it makes against it. Damages to
Tenant’s room in the Premises shall be assessed to Tenant and/or other lessees
of the Premises at Landlord’s sole discretion. Damages to common areas in the
Premises shall be assessed to Tenant or Tenants at Landlord’s sole discretion.
Security Deposit Act communications shall be sent to Landlord. Tenant may not
elect to use the security deposit for rent. If Tenant causes damages that exceed
the security deposit, Tenant will pay those excess damages immediately upon
receiving notice thereof. If Landlord is in possession of a security deposit
from a prior lease period, Tenant consents that the security deposit may be held
by Landlord and applied to the security deposit required under this Lease, even
if the terms of the two leases are not consecutive or do not allow for
uninterrupted occupancy.

\subsection{Place of Payment and Notices}
Tenant’s rent shall be delivered or mailed to Billing Service. Landlord’s
notices to Tenant (other than security deposit claim notices) shall be delivered
or mailed to the Premises. Tenant’s notices to Landlord, including security
deposit communications, shall be delivered or mailed to \emph{Alumni Advisor
\AlumniAdvisorName, \AlumniAdvisorAddress}, or to another location if notice of
such location is provided to Tenant by Landlord in writing. Notices required by
this Lease or by law shall be in writing. Notices that are mailed (including
security deposit claim notices) are deemed received by the addressee on the next
regular day for delivery of mail after being properly addressed, stamped with
sufficient postage, and deposited in a United States mailbox.

\subsection{Cancellation Due to Associate Membership}
If Tenant is an associate member of the Fraternity on the Lease Due Date and
Tenant is not an initiated member of the Fraternity on
\DTMdate{\DTMfetchyear{lease due date}-05-last}, then either Tenant or Landlord
may end this Lease. If this Lease is so ended, any money paid by Tenant on
account of this Lease shall be refunded promptly by Landlord, and Tenant and
Landlord shall have no further obligations under this Lease.

\subsection{Application of Tenant’s Money}
Money received by Landlord from Tenant (or on Tenant’s behalf) shall be applied
to Tenant’s account as follows: first to satisfy late fees, returned check fees,
and to other fees owed by Tenant; second to maintenance and repair costs
chargeable to Tenant; third to collection fees, legal fees and court costs
legally chargeable to Tenant, including costs incurred prior to curing a
default; fourth to security or membership deposits or portions thereof due from
Tenant; fifth to charges, fines, and assessments against Landlord caused by
Tenant; sixth to rent; and seventh to food service charges, if any. Restrictive
language on a check or in any communication, including those accompanying a
payment, shall not constitute an accord and satisfaction or amend this
provision.

\subsection{Taking Possession and Moving In}
Tenant shall neither take possession of Tenant’s room in the Premises nor be
allowed to use the Premises’ common areas unless and until the late lease fee
(if any), first month’s rent, security deposit, and any other amounts due the
Landlord are paid. If Tenant does not take possession by the start of the Term
and Tenant has not notified Landlord in writing that Tenant will take possession
at a later time, Landlord may conclude that Tenant has abandoned the Premises
and re-rent them. If the Premises are not ready for occupancy at the start of
the Term, Landlord’s sole liability to Tenant is abatement of Tenant’s rent, in
the same percentage that the Premises are not ready for occupancy, from the
start of the Term to when the Premises are ready for occupancy, which time is at
Landlord’s exclusive determination.

Tenant has received a Move-In Form and shall return a completed copy of it to
Landlord within 7~days after moving in. The Premises are conclusively presumed
to be in good condition upon moving in unless Tenant specifies objections on the
Move-In Form. Such objections are not a request for repairs.

\subsection{Maintenance}
Tenant shall maintain the Premises in a neat, clean, and orderly manner; use and
maintain them in accordance with applicable police, sanitary, and all other
regulations imposed by governmental authorities; observe all reasonable
regulations and requirements of underwriters concerning use and condition of the
Premises tending to reduce fire hazard and insurance rates; and immediately
inform Landlord when there is a need for Landlord to perform repairs or
maintenance. Tenant shall not cause or permit any waste or misuse of any utility
fixtures or of any portion of the Premises. During the Term of this Lease,
Tenant is responsible for all damages to the Premises caused by Tenant, Tenant’s
guests, invitees, licensees, agents or by unknown parties. Tenant shall
reimburse Landlord for all damages caused by such waste or misuse; for all
permits, inspection, and certification costs Landlord incurs because of Tenant’s
noncompliance with this Lease or applicable laws; and for all damages resulting
from Tenant’s not timely reporting the need for repair or maintenance. Landlord
may invoice Tenant for the cost of any repairs\slash replacements (other than
normal wear and tear) during the Term of this Lease. The amount of such invoices
is deemed unpaid rent and shall be due with the rent installment for the month
following the month in which the invoice is sent. Unless authorized Chapter
representatives designate to which Tenant invoices for repairs or damages should
be allocated, invoices shall be allocated equally among all Tenants. Tenant
shall pay and be liable to Landlord and/or Landlord’s insurer (in contract
and/or tort) for the repair of all damage to, and/or replacement of, the
Premises and structure of which they are a part, including fire and flood
damage, in any way caused or made necessary by Tenant, Tenant’s guests,
invitees, licensees, or agents. Nothing in this provision waives or lessens
Landlord’s obligation to maintain and repair the Premises under Michigan law,
but Landlord is not so liable when it has not been informed of the need to
repair. Landlord’s reasonable exercise of any right or obligation hereunder
never shall be deemed an eviction of Tenant or interference with Tenant’s use
and possession of the Premises, and Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant
because of Landlord’s actions in reasonably fulfilling its obligations
hereunder.

\subsection{Moving Out}
Tenant shall return the Premises at the expiration of the Term (or earlier
termination) in as good a condition as when received, reasonable wear and tear
excepted. Early surrender of the Premises, including surrender accepted in
writing, does not extinguish any of Tenant’s obligations to perform under this
Lease, including payment of all rent required herein.

\subsection{Alterations}
Tenant shall not alter or remodel the Premises (or any room or portion thereof)
without prior written consent of Landlord. Tenant may, within the bounds of
Tenant’s room, install flooring, install non-permanent decorations, or construct
self-supporting sleeping lofts in a manner so as to not damage the ceiling,
walls or floors and in compliance with all building, fire and safety codes.
Tenant may paint the walls and ceilings a neutral white or beige color. If
Tenant paints the walls or ceilings any other color, this will be considered
damage and Tenant may be charged the cost to repaint such areas. If Tenant
desires to determine if a specific color is acceptable, Tenant should obtain
advance, written permission from Landlord.

Landlord is not responsible for the floor coverings, window coverings, wall and
ceiling colors, or decorating in a sleeping room. Tenant will remove, repair and
return each room to the same condition as delivered, including the removal of
all non-permanent decorating including tape, adhesives, nails, poster putty,
\textit{etc}. Floor coverings, wall colors and ceiling colors do not have to be
restored and may remain at the end of the Term. Tenant agrees to pay all costs
incurred by Landlord to remove or repair any prohibited alteration and to
restore the Premises to its original condition.

\subsection{Utility Charges}
Utility charges relating to the Premises, including water, sewer, gas,
electricity, and alarm monitoring services shall be paid by Landlord. Landlord
is not responsible for utility service interruptions that are beyond its control
or due to necessary repairs, replacements, or alterations.

\subsection{Internet and Television}
Landlord shall arrange and pay for internet service including any necessary
routers. Landlord shall arrange and pay for basic cable television services.
Tenant shall arrange and pay for any necessary cable television boxes or
decoders. Tenant may not modify internet or cable television services. Tenant
may not install any new wiring or make any alterations to the Premises without
the prior written approval of Landlord. Any unauthorized changes or alterations
shall be considered damages and Tenant shall be responsible for the costs to
fully restore any alterations.

\subsection{Entry by Landlord}
Landlord may enter the Premises in an emergency or to perform repairs,
maintenance, inspections, appraisals, insurance inspections, other purposes
reasonably related to the operation of the building, and to show the Premises
for sale or lease. Except during an emergency or when Landlord reasonably
believes there is an emergency, all entries shall be made during reasonable
hours, and Landlord shall make reasonable efforts to inform Tenant of its
intention to enter Tenant’s room and to establish a mutually acceptable time.
Tenant and Landlord agree that access to the common areas of the Premises during
reasonable hours for the purposes stated herein do not require notice to
Tenant.

\subsection{Default and Remedies}\label{Default and Remedies}
Tenant’s noncompliance with any provision of this Lease is a default. Tenant
shall also be in default and Landlord may (but is not obligated to) terminate
this Lease by written notice, as required by law, upon occurrence of any of the
following events:

\begin{compactList}{(\alph{enumi})}{\usecounter{enumi}}
  \item Tenant pays rent late on three or more occasions.
  \item The Fraternity revokes the Chapter’s charter.
  \item Tenant is expelled or resigns from the Chapter or the Fraternity.
  \item Tenant is expelled from the University of Michigan.
  \item Tenant is convicted of or pleads no contest to a felony crime.
\end{compactList}

If Tenant defaults, Landlord may have all remedies legally permitted, including
termination of this Lease by written notice and declaring all remaining rental
installments immediately due and owing. Landlord may terminate this Lease on
24~hours written notice if Tenant, a member of Tenant’s family, or a guest of
Tenant unlawfully manufactures, delivers, possesses with intent to deliver, or
possesses a controlled substance on the Premises. Tenant shall reimburse
Landlord for all legal fees, costs, and expenses legally recoverable and for all
damages caused by Tenant’s default, including costs of re-renting the Premises,
such as showing, advertising, and preparing the Premises; unpaid rent up to the
end of this Lease; and the maximum amount of interest allowed by Michigan law on
Tenant’s debt, from the date Tenant vacates. Tenants may not be liable for the
total accelerated amount because of Landlord’s obligation to minimize its
damages, and either Tenant or Landlord may have a court determine the actual
amount owed. Once this Lease is ended, whether because of default or otherwise,
Tenant waives any and all rights to reinstate or renew this Lease.

\subsection{Mediation}
Landlord and/or Tenant may request that the University of Michigan Off-Campus
Housing Program assist in disputes, \provisoMarker{provided} that Tenant is a
student of the University of Michigan. Landlord and Tenant shall make a
reasonable and good faith effort to settle such disputes through the Off-Campus
Housing Program. Off-Campus Housing Program staff may enter and inspect the
Premises after notice to Landlord and Tenant and at reasonable times. This
provision shall not preclude other legal rights of Landlord or Tenant. Landlord
and Tenant agree to keep mediation proceedings confidential.

\subsection{Hold Harmless}
Tenant agrees for himself, his heirs, and personal representatives to hold
Landlord harmless from all damages, including damages to the Premises and
structure of which they are a part; all lost rents for the Premises and
structure of which they are a part; and all liability that results from his
negligent or illegal use of the Premises and from his intentional misuse of
them, including common areas. When claims against Landlord’s insurance are paid
because of acts or omissions of Tenant, Tenant’s visitors, guests, or invitees,
Tenant will reimburse Landlord for any insurance deductible it pays.

\subsection{Damage to Tenant’s Property}
Landlord does not provide any insurance coverage for personal property of
Tenant, Tenant’s guests or invitees, and shall not be liable for any damage,
loss, or destruction of such property from any cause, including acts or
omissions of third parties, unless caused by Landlord’s nonperformance or
negligent performance of a duty imposed by law or by their grossly negligent or
intentional actions. Tenant specifically is encouraged to insure Tenant’s
personal property.

\subsection{Amendment}
This Lease may be amended in writing only, signed by Landlord and Tenant; except
that on 30~days written notice to Tenant, Landlord may (i)~amend this Lease to
conform with changes required by federal, state, or local law, rule, or
regulation or to implement changes in rules relating to the Premises which are
required to protect the physical health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment of
tenants and guests; and (ii)~increase required rental payments to cover
additional costs incurred by Landlord in operating the Premises because of any
increase in \textit{ad valorem} property taxes, charges for the electricity,
heating fuel, water consumed at the property, or increases in premiums paid for
liability, fire, or worker compensation insurance. Upon giving such notice, this
Lease is deemed amended in accord with the terms specified in the notice. If the
new rental rate starts other than on the 15th~day of a calendar month, the
amount of increase due from the start date to the 15th~day of the next calendar
month will be pro-rated on a 30-day month basis and due as part of the rent
installment for that next calendar month.

\subsection{Waiver}
Landlord’s non-enforcement of a provision of this Lease on one or more occasions
is not a continuing waiver of Landlord’s right to enforce the provision, and its
consent to an act of Tenant on one or more occasions (where consent is required)
is not a continuing consent to any subsequent similar act by Tenant. No breach
is waived by Landlord unless waived in writing.

\subsection{Severability}
Neither a court ruling that a portion of this Lease is invalid nor Landlord’s
and Tenant’s written agreement not to observe a portion of this Lease shall
invalidate any other portions of this Lease.

\subsection{Successors Bound}
Heirs, successors, assigns, and representatives of Landlord and Tenant shall be
bound by the provisions of this Lease.

\subsection{Use and Quiet Enjoyment}
Tenant shall comply with all applicable laws and ordinances; use the Premises
only for strictly residential purposes; and refrain from all conduct that
unreasonably disturbs other tenants, occupants, neighbors of the building, or
Landlord. No business of any sort shall be located in or conducted from the
Premises. Tenant is entitled to quiet enjoyment of the Premises throughout the
Term of this Lease so long as Tenant complies with the Lease’s provisions.

\subsection{Untenantability}
If the Premises become wholly untenantable because of fire or other casualty,
Landlord may terminate this Lease by written notice to Tenant, and Tenant shall
surrender the Premises to Landlord. If for the same reasons the Premises become
partially untenantable, or wholly untenantable without Landlord’s terminating
this Lease, Landlord shall repair the Premises with reasonable speed. From the
date of the casualty, until repairs are substantially completed, rent shall
abate in the same percentage that the Premises are untenantable, unless the
untenantability is caused by negligence or intentional misconduct of Tenant, his
family, occupants, employees, guests, invitees, agents, or anyone on the Premises
by reason of association with any of them, in which case rent shall not abate.
Landlord is not liable for failure to repair until Tenant notifies Landlord of
the need for repair and a reasonable time to make the repair has passed
thereafter. For purposes of Landlord’s right to terminate this Lease, the
Premises are \definedTermDeclaration{wholly untenantable} if 50\% or more of the
Premises are untenantable.

\subsection{Assignment, Subletting, and Occupancy}
Tenant may not assign this Lease or sublet any of the Premises without
Landlord’s prior written permission. Landlord may require that any lease
assignment or sublet is to another member of the Chapter. Landlord may evaluate
proposed assignees and subtenants as it evaluates prospective Tenant, including
acceptability to remaining prime Tenant. Only Tenant may occupy the Premises.
Tenant may not have any guest occupy Tenant’s room for more than 4~consecutive
days.

\subsection{Abandonment}
During the Term, if Landlord believes that Tenant has abandoned the Premises and
current rent is unpaid, Landlord may enter the Premises and remove remaining
possessions of Tenant without liability therefor. Abandonment is presumed
conclusively if rent is unpaid for 15~days following the due date and (i)~a
substantial portion of Tenant’s possessions have been removed or
(ii)~acquaintances of Tenant or other reliable sources advise Landlord that
Tenant has left without intending to re-occupy the Premises. If Tenant abandons
or surrenders the Premises at any time and leaves personal property there,
Landlord may dispose of it however Landlord chooses, and Tenant shall reimburse
Landlord for all costs it incurs in that regard.

\subsection{Holding Over}
Tenant shall vacate the Premises on or before the end of the Term. If Tenant
retains possession thereafter without Landlord’s written permission, Landlord
has 30~days from the end of the Term to sue for possession under section
600.5714(1)(C)(2) of the Michigan Summary Proceedings Act (Holding over after
lease expires). If suit is not begun within that time, the tenancy shall
continue on a month-to-month basis from the end of the Term, and all other
provisions of this Lease shall remain in full force and effect; except that rent
shall increase to \monthlyRentDuringHoldover\ per month, beginning on the first
day after the Term, regardless of whether suit is brought or the tenancy becomes
month-to-month. Landlord’s acceptance of money from Tenant during the 30~days
following the end of the Term does not waive Landlord’s right to seek possession
as described in this provision, and Tenant shall compensate Landlord for all
damages caused by Tenant’s unauthorized holdover.

\subsection{Entire Agreement}\label{Entire Agreement}
This Lease, including the Rules and Regulations Addendum, is the entire
agreement of Landlord and Tenant, and they enter it voluntarily. There are no
other agreements that are part of this Lease or to which Landlord and Tenant are
bound unless specifically enumerated herein.

\subsection{Property Insurance}
Landlord shall, in its sole discretion, obtain property insurance on the
Premises and owner’s liability insurance. Landlord shall pay all such property
and liability insurance premiums and real estate taxes.

\subsection{Waiver of Subrogation}
Each policy of insurance authorized or required of either party under this Lease
shall contain a clause or endorsement under which the insurer waives all right
of subrogation against the other party, its agents and employees with respect to
losses payable under such policy, and each party hereby waives all right of
recovery it might otherwise have against the other party, its agents and
employees for any loss or injury which is covered by such a policy of insurance,
notwithstanding that such loss or injury may result from the negligence or fault
of such other party, its agents or employees.

\subsection{Time}
Time is of the essence of this Lease.

\subsection{Captions}
Captions are to assist with identification and have no legal significance.

The following rules and regulations are part of this Lease as provided by
Section~\ref{Entire Agreement} on page~\pageref{Entire Agreement}.

\subsection{Furnishings}
The Premises are partially furnished. All furnishings in the Premises are part
of the Premises. Landlord agrees to furnish Tenant with one bed, one desk, one
desk chair and one built-in clothes closet and drawers for Tenant’s use.
Landlord has provided to Tenant certain common areas and common furnishings,
fixtures, and equipment that Tenant is entitled to use during the Term. Tenant
shall maintain said common areas and common furnishings, fixtures, and equipment
in clean and good condition. Tenant shall not remove any such furnishings,
fixtures, appliances or equipment. If any furnishings remain from prior Tenants,
Tenant may utilize those furnishings.

\subsection{Keys}
Landlord may retain a key to the Premises throughout the Term. Tenant shall not
change any lock without Landlord’s prior written consent. Landlord may also
charge Tenant a reasonable amount for assisting Tenant in gaining entry to the
Premises. Upon termination of this Lease, all keys shall be labeled and returned
to the Chapter president or house manager, and the Chapter’s representative
shall return all keys to Landlord when the Premises have been vacated. If the
key to Tenant’s room is not returned to Landlord, Tenant shall pay as additional
rent \$25.00. Keys returned to Landlord individually or after the date of
vacating the Premises shall not waive such charges.

\subsection{Parking}
Tenant may be assigned one or more vehicle parking spaces available at the
Premises according to the policies of the Chapter. Landlord makes no warranties
or guarantees that vehicle parking spaces sufficient to accommodate the vehicles
of all Tenants will be available at the Premises. Tenant shall park only on the
